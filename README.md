# ChaseInPositivity
Project to increase retention for the "Be Positive" non-profit Orginzation.
## Technologies used :
  [D3.js library](https://d3js.org/)
  [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
  [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)
  [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
### Our Frontend
React and Bootstrap were our frontend tools, such as the navagation bar and header buttons. The D3 library used was our data visualization tool to create dynamic bubbles that would adjust accordingly based off of the data input.

### Our Backend
Postgres was picked as our relational databased because of the need to have unique identifiers for our project and ease of scalability. Our database was hosted on an Amazon Web Server and we used Postman to make requests, tests, and used for debugging.
